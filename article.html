                        <span class="font-semibold text-base md:text-lg">The Portuguese was adored by fans after leading the club to
                            a
                            European trophy - but this season's results and performances were dire
                        </span>
                        
                        <br><br>

                        Jose Mourinho was booed before kick-off at San Siro on Sunday night - which was utterly
                        unsurprising. After all, his Roma side were playing AC Milan at the Giuseppe Meazza - not
                        Mourinho's beloved Inter, with whom the Portuguese shares an unbreakable bond forged by the
                        Nerazzurri's treble triumph of 2010. It was inevitable that as soon as his face appeared on the
                        big screen, Milanisti would make their disapproval heard. <br><br>

                        What was noteworthy, though, was the vitriol to which Mourinho's team were subjected by their
                        own fans after the game, which ended in a 3-1 win for the hosts. As Roma's players went to
                        acknowledge the 4,000-strong travelling support, they were met with open hostility and
                        challenged to prove their testicular fortitude. "We've hit rock bottom," striker Andrea Belotti
                        admitted afterwards. <br><br>

                        Mourinho wasn't present for this bitter backlash, with his latest suspension for lashing out at
                        officials meaning he had been once again prevented from taking a seat on the bench, forced
                        instead to watch on from the stands. But he didn't escape criticism. Indeed, for the first time
                        since he took charge of Roma in 2021, some supporters started to question Mourinho's
                        methods.<br><br>

                        One frustrated fan wrote online, "Mourinho has ruined us even more than Monchi" - which was one
                        hell of an accusation, given the disastrous nature of the Spaniard's tenure as sporting
                        director. But the online attacks were indicative of a significant shift in mood and, ultimately,
                        signalled the end of Mourinho's Roma reign.<br><br>

                        </span><br><br>

                        'The Special One' was greeted like a god when he arrived at Roma, held up as a saviour by the
                        club's
                        long-suffering supporters, and the fans' faith was rewarded with a European trophy (the
                        Conference
                        League) at the end of Mourinho's first season at the Stadio Olimpico.<br><br>

                        Mourinho really was their messiah and Giallorossi hung on his every word. When he verbally
                        assaulted referees, they did too. Granted, there were some concerns over the style of play (or
                        lack thereof) and some dissenting voices - most notably former Roma forward Antonio Cassano -
                        but for a long, long time they were drowned out by Roma's new cult hero and his loyal
                        followers.<br><br>

                        However, some blind believers became doubters during the past six months, as another club came
                        down with the third-season syndrome that has blighted Mourinho's managerial career. Indeed, it
                        was obvious very early on during the 2023-24 campaign that all was not right at Roma,
                        particularly behind the scenes.<br><br>

                            Roma 'in a deep crisis'
                        </span><br><br>

                        Sunday's loss at San Siro left Roma ninth in Serie A after winning just one of their previous
                        six league games, while last week they were knocked out of the Coppa Italia by Lazio.<br><br>

                        As the Gazzetta dello Sport wrote on Monday, the club was "in a deep crisis" and the question
                        being asked by journalists, fans and reportedly even by Mourinho himself was whether the
                        two-time Champions League winner was still the right man to lead Roma out of it.<br><br>

                        Before the trip to Milan, there was already talk that Roma's American owners, The Friedkin
                        Group, were considering sacking Mourinho and replacing him with club legend Daniele De Rossi, at
                        least on an interim basis. It was also alleged after the game that Mourinho had told his players
                        that he was willing to resign, as he felt they were no longer following his
                        instructions.<br><br>

                            'Gruelling' team meeting
                        </span><br><br>

                        Mourinho had admitted before the Milan match that he had held a "gruelling" team meeting after
                        the derby defeat and that "some individuals" had come in for especially severe criticism.
                        However, while Mourinho clearly believed that certain players are not giving enough for the
                        cause, he has refused to name and shame, primarily because he was, in general, happy with the
                        effort being put in by what he felt was an overstretched squad.<br><br>

                        And this was the heart of the matter as far as Mourinho was concerned. He simply did not believe
                        that he had sufficient resources at his disposal to challenge for a top-four finish in Serie
                        A.<br><br>

                        He repeatedly highlighted his team's injury issues, and particularly those relating to Paulo
                        Dybala, acknowledging that Roma are simply not the same side without their talented
                        No.21.<br><br>

                        Of course, many would argue that relying so heavily on a player with such an atrocious fitness
                        record was a recipe for disaster anyway, but Roma's lack of depth allowed Mourinho to revisit a
                        theme he has always brought up whenever he is criticised for failing or struggling to achieve a
                        particular goal - namely that he is a victim of his own success.<br><br>

                        "We're four points off a target (Champions League football) that if it wasn't us we're talking
                        about, everyone would say is an impossible target," he argued last week. "If you look at the
                        potential of the teams that really should be finishing in the top four, you can't compare them
                        to us.<br><br>

                        "But this is us. This is Roma, with the most incredible fans I've ever seen, and with a coach
                        people think [is called] Jose 'Harry Potter' Mourinho and not Jose Mourinho Felix, whose name
                        immediately raises expectations and demands."<br><br>

                            'We can't go any lower'
                        </span><br><br>

                        Nobody can deny that Mourinho did a good job in difficult circumstances in his first two seasons
                        at the Olimpico and he certainly shouldn't be be held solely responsible for Roma's current
                        woes.<br><br>

                        Tiago Pinto is parting company with the club next month and few fans will be sorry to see the
                        sporting director go, given there have been more misses than hits in the transfer market during
                        his three years at Roma. Even his biggest coups - landing Dybala and Romelu Lukaku - are now
                        being re-evaluated, given the Argentine attacker's aforementioned and long-established
                        fragility, and the Belgian striker's well-known propensity for disappearing in big games.<br><br>

                        Mourinho's plea for greater support from the club, particularly when it came to dealing with the
                        press, also went unheeded by his employers. He felt overburdened for a long, long time, as if he
                        were doing three or four jobs at once.<br><br>

                        However, sympathy is in short supply among the general public right now. Firstly, the football
                        was typically terrible, the results rotten, and the touchline conduct of the coach and his staff
                        consistently disgraceful. Many have quite rightly wondered why Mourinho has expended so much
                        time and energy waging war on officials and opponents that would have been better utilised
                        getting the best out of a team that was damningly bereft of ideas and confidence. "We can't go
                        any lower," Belotti told DAZN on Sunday evening.<br><br>

                        Just over a month ago, fans at the Stadio Olimpico unfurled a banner hailing Mourinho as a
                        "Romanista for life" and he will be forever welcome at the capital club. But some of even
                        Mourinho's most loyal followers were starting to question their faith in the supposed 'Special
                        One', making his exit both inevitable and necessary.<br><br>
